# Integration with Coding LLMs and Agents

KraphT was designed with composability and structured reasoning in mind. These same characteristics make it a strong candidate for integration with AI-based agents or LLMs, especially those capable of:

- Generating code (e.g., Go or rule syntax)
- Learning from graph patterns
- Emitting structured outputs like triples or rules

## 1. Interface-First Design Enables AI-Generated Components

Each KraphT component operates on well-defined interfaces (e.g., `TripleExtractor`, `RuleEvaluator`, `EntityStore`). This makes it easy to insert agent-generated modules that conform to expected contracts.

**Opportunities**:

- An LLM could generate or refine a new `Rule` implementation based on user descriptions.
- An agent could propose changes to `TripleExtractionRule` logic when data formats evolve.
- Code-generated rules can be tested and deployed dynamically as plugins or sidecar services.

## 2. Rule Language Is Minimal and Readable

KraphT’s rules are designed to be human-readable and declarative JSON, making them ideal for prompting and evaluation by coding LLMs.

**Examples**:

From natural language prompt:

"If temperature exceeds 30C and depth is 0, emit a surface_heat_alert"

To structured rule JSON:

```json

{
  "id": "surface_heat_alert_rule",
  "description": "Detect high surface temperatures",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "match": "(?s:*) hasReading ?r",
      "constraints": []
    },
    {
      "match": "?r measuresProperty Temperature",
      "constraints": []
    },
    {
      "match": "?r hasValue ?v",
      "constraints": [{"type": "numeric", "operation": "gt", "value": 30.0}]
    },
    {
      "match": "?r measuresDepth ?d",
      "constraints": [{"type": "numeric", "operation": "eq", "value": 0.0}]
    }
  ],
  "timeWindow": "1m",
  "action": {
    "type": "emit",
    "triple": {
      "subject": "?s",
      "predicate": "hasAlert",
      "object": "SurfaceHeatAlert-{{uuid}}"
    }
  }
}
```

These rules can be expressed as natural language prompts with context templates that LLMs can safely parse and write.

## 3. Triples as an AI-Friendly Format

Triples are a natural data structure for both symbolic reasoning and LLM-based generation. Agents can:

- Convert text into (subject, predicate, object) structures
- Enrich nodes with inferred properties or tags
- Summarize recent graph activity into new fact suggestions

## 4. Stream-Based Architecture Allows for Asynchronous Agents

Because KraphT is based on event streams (via NATS), LLMs or agents do not have to be embedded—they can subscribe to relevant topics and emit new triples, suggestions, or rules.

**Examples**:

- An agent listens to all new salinity readings and suggests range rules based on historical patterns
- A retriever-augmented LLM watches parsed logs and emits annotations for unknown hostnames or users

## 5. Challenges and Considerations

| Challenge                          | Mitigation or Approach                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| LLM hallucination or low precision| Require rule validation before injection    |
| Code safety and execution risks   | Run in sandboxed plugin model               |
| Context window limitations        | Use few-shot or streaming summaries         |
| Debuggability                     | Require generated rules to be auditable and traceable |

## Example Use Cases

- **LLM-assisted rule authoring**: A developer describes a desired behavior, and an LLM drafts Go code for a rule.
- **Triple summarization**: An agent monitors a stream of triples and emits narrative summaries.
- **Graph completion**: An embedding-powered agent suggests missing edges based on observed subgraphs.
- **Anomaly tagging**: LLMs classify unusual triple patterns using trained reasoning.

## Summary

KraphT’s design — modular, event-driven, and structurally explicit — is well-suited for integration with coding LLMs or AI agents. These integrations can occur through:

- Rule generation or refinement
- Triple augmentation or suggestion
- Graph summarization or classification

With appropriate safeguards, KraphT can serve as both a consumer and collaborator with autonomous reasoning tools.
