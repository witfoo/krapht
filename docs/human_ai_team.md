# Human-AI Collaboration by Design

KraphT is intentionally designed to support collaboration between human analysts and automated systems. It does not seek to replace human judgment or overwhelm users with opaque automation. Instead, it provides a framework where each party—human and machine—can contribute their strengths.

## What Humans Do Best

- **Contextual understanding**: Humans interpret intent, nuance, and mission goals in ways that structured systems cannot.
- **Rule expression**: Subject matter experts can define high-level relationships and heuristics that capture meaningful patterns.
- **Oversight and validation**: Humans can spot misalignments or errors in reasoning that an automated system might not detect.
- **Curated insight**: Analysts can synthesize high-volume graph activity into prioritized leads or decisions.

## What KraphT Automates Effectively

- **Fact extraction**: From structured logs and data streams, KraphT transforms raw input into semantically meaningful triples.
- **Pattern detection**: Rules are applied at machine speed across high-volume data, ensuring nothing is missed due to fatigue or inconsistency.
- **Graph enrichment**: KraphT continuously maintains a living map of entities and relationships as new information arrives.
- **Rule enforcement**: Logic defined by humans is consistently and deterministically applied across time and space.

## A Co-Designed Intelligence Layer

KraphT acts as a reasoning layer that makes human-authored logic actionable, observable, and testable. Analysts can:

- Prototype rules in plain logic or code
- Simulate behavior before committing
- Visualize how entities evolve across time
- Use rule matches as investigative leads, not decisions

This design ensures that automation enhances—not replaces—human oversight. Analysts retain control, while the system handles the scale and precision that tools do best.

## Summary

KraphT is a framework that amplifies human insight by embedding it in a system capable of continuous, explainable, and scalable reasoning. It recognizes that true intelligence in operations comes from combining expert-driven structure with automated precision.
