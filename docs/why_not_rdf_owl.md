# Why Not RDF and OWL?

Some may argue that RDF, OWL, and SPARQL already solve the kinds of problems KraphT addresses. RDF and OWL solve many problems in theory. KraphT solves 80 percent of the interoperability and reasoning problems with 20 percent of the complexity.

KraphT provides a simpler, composable, and operationally efficient path for organizations that need structured reasoning but do not require formal ontologies or semantic web tooling.

KraphT can evolve toward formal semantics later, but it starts where most teams are today.

## Valid Benefits of RDF/OWL

- RDF and OWL are W3C standards with mature support.
- Formal ontologies exist for many domains (e.g., SOSA/SSN for sensors).
- SPARQL and OWL reasoners enable complex graph querying and inference.
- These technologies align with FAIR data and Linked Open Data principles.

## Why KraphT Takes a Simpler Path

1. **Developer Accessibility**

   Most development teams are not trained in ontology engineering or SPARQL. KraphT enables reasoning with simple, readable rules over structured data. No special semantic web expertise is required.

2. **Operational Simplicity**

   KraphT uses lightweight components such as NATS, JetStream, and key-value stores. There is no requirement to set up RDF triplestores or semantic reasoners.

3. **Real-Time and Event-Driven**

   RDF systems often operate in batch or query-driven workflows. KraphT is built for real-time event processing, inference, and graph enrichment.

4. **Controlled Complexity**

   KraphT avoids the overhead of full semantic modeling. It focuses on emitting actionable facts and relationships that are immediately useful for downstream services and users.

In short, RDF and OWL provide powerful mechanisms for semantic modeling. KraphT provides an operationally simpler path to useful inference and graph construction, particularly in environments where speed, transparency, and flexibility matter.

## Optional RDF and OWL Support

Although KraphT does not require RDF or OWL, it is designed to support them as optional extensions.

### 1. Rule Profiles Aligned to Ontologies

Rules can be written to emit triples using predicates and object types that correspond to well-known ontologies. This allows teams to align their data models with formal vocabularies when needed.

### 2. RDF Export as a Post-Processing Service

Downstream services can consume triples from KraphT and transform them into RDF serialization formats such as Turtle, RDF/XML, or JSON-LD. These outputs can be published to a SPARQL endpoint or loaded into existing triplestores.

### 3. OWL Reasoning as an Optional Layer

Organizations that require formal reasoning can export enriched graphs from KraphT and load them into OWL-compatible systems such as Apache Jena. This supports class-based inference, hierarchy resolution, and ontology alignment without affecting core pipeline performance.

### Summary

KraphT is ontology-compatible, but not ontology-dependent. It provides a practical on-ramp to structured reasoning that can optionally connect to formal semantic web infrastructure. This ensures accessibility for engineering teams and extensibility for semantic specialists.
