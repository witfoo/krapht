# Plugin Pattern for Safe Rule Submission

KraphT can be extended to safely support rules generated by LLMs or autonomous agents by implementing a plugin-based architecture that enforces validation, isolation, and observability.

## 1. RulePlugin Interface

Each rule must conform to a shared interface, such as:

* Unique ID (for traceability)
* Human-readable name and description
* `Evaluate()` function to process input triples
* `Validate()` method to ensure safety and correctness

This promotes consistent behavior and prevents arbitrary code from being executed.

## 2. Plugin Registry

KraphT includes a registry that:

* Tracks all registered rules
* Validates each rule during registration
* Provides an `EvaluateAll()` method to apply all rules to an input

This enables dynamic rule execution and hot-swappable updates.

## 3. LLM Submission Endpoint (Optional)

KraphT may expose an endpoint like `/rules/submit` that accepts:

* Stringified Go source code or JSON-encoded rule definitions
* Agent identity and optional digital signature
* Description and metadata
* Test input for simulation or dry run

The system would:

* Parse and validate the rule
* Test it in a sandbox
* Reject if unsafe or incorrect
* Register if valid

## 4. Execution Sandbox Options

| Option            | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Static Plugins    | Build into the system manually                     |
| Yaegi Interpreter | Interpret Go code dynamically (safe subset)        |
| Sidecar Worker    | Forward rule execution to isolated external worker |

These approaches allow testing or dynamic loading without full recompilation.

## 5. Safety Measures

| Risk                     | Mitigation Strategy                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Arbitrary code execution | Restrict to safe interpreter like Yaegi      |
| Resource exhaustion      | Apply timeouts and CPU/memory limits         |
| Rule regressions         | Require test inputs and dry-run evaluation   |
| Lack of traceability     | Log all submissions and assign versioned IDs |

## 6. Summary

The proposed RulePlugin architecture enables:

* Flexible rule generation by AI agents or LLMs
* Controlled onboarding via sandbox and validation
* Runtime modularity with consistent behavior

This design ensures KraphT remains safe, extensible, and auditable as it evolves toward intelligent, autonomous graph enrichment.
