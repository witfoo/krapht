# TypeDB as an Optional Knowledge Store

KraphT's event-driven approach to knowledge construction can be paired with TypeDB for complex querying and advanced reasoning capabilities.

## 1. KraphT to TypeDB Integration

KraphT can process real-time events and generate enriched relationship data, which can then be periodically synced to TypeDB. This provides:

- Real-time processing via KraphT's lightweight event pipeline
- Advanced querying through TypeDB's logical querying capabilities
- Automated inference using TypeDB's built-in reasoning engine

## 2. Complementary Strengths

While KraphT excels at real-time event processing and simple rule-based reasoning, TypeDB provides:

- Hypergraph data modeling for complex relationships
- Type constraint validation ensuring data integrity
- Built-in logical inference through TypeQL
- Conceptual abstraction for domain modeling

## 3. Implementation Approach

A consumer service can:

- Subscribe to enriched relationship data from KraphT
- Transform these relationships into TypeDB schema-compliant format
- Batch insert data into TypeDB for analytical workloads
- Expose TypeQL queries through an API service

This hybrid approach maintains KraphT's operational simplicity while enabling TypeDB's powerful knowledge modeling when needed for complex queries.
